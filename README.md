## Objective:
#### The goal of this project is to develop a Deep learning model to detect diseases in leaves based on images. Candidates will design and implement their own deep learning architecture to achieve the best possible performance.


### 1. Dataset Acquisition:
#### Download the dataset from Kaggle Leaf Disease Detection Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dev523/leaf-disease-detection-dataset


### 2. Data Preprocessing:
####    Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for model training.
####    Implement data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset without altering the original images' color information.


### 3. Model Building:
#### Design a deep learning architecture for leaf disease detection.Choose CNN architecture (Xception) that they believe will achieve the best performance.
#### Train the model using the training dataset and validate it using the provided test set.
#### Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.


### 4. Application Interface:
#### Created a user friendly interface using Streamlit that allows users to upload leaf images and receive disease predictions.
#### Include options for displaying the uploaded image and the predicted disease class with its probability.
