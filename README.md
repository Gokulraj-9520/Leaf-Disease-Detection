## Objective:
#### The goal of this project is to develop a Deep learning model to detect diseases in leaves based on images. Candidates will design and implement their own deep learning architecture to achieve the best possible performance.


### 1. Dataset Acquisition:
#### Download the dataset from Kaggle Leaf Disease Detection Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dev523/leaf-disease-detection-dataset
